## What is zopyx.surveyjs

`zopyx.surveyjs` integrates the Javascript framework
[SurveyJS](https://surveyjs.io) into Plone. A survey in SurveyJS is represented
through a JSON datastructure, the polls are also represented as JSON.

SurveyJS consistent of serveral components:

- the SurveyJS `Library` which is open-source and rendered a poll given through
  its JSON representation within the browser

- the SurveyJS `Creator` is a visual survey designer/form builder for SurveyJS.
  The source code of the `Creator` is freely available. The `Creator` is not available
  for *free commercial usage*. Commercial usage requires a developer license.

- there is also a `PDF Export` and `Analytics Pack` available.

In any case, check the [SurveyJS license](https://surveyjs.io/Licenses).

## Background

This implementation is funded through a customer project from the educational
sector.  With a very small number of persons (1-2) using this tool. The costs
for one or two developer license are in this case neglectable compared to the
benefits. The decision for using SurveyJS for a poll functionality in Plone
followed a after an in-depth evaluation of various options. Unfortunately,
we could not find any other suitable solution as free/open-source software.
A mixture of commercial and free components are acceptable for us, if there is a
certain value added to the project compared to less powerfull free/open-source tools.
